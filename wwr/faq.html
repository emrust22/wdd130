                <h2>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
                <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age.</p>

                <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe? Can I still come if I don't know how to swim? </h2>
                <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time.</p>

                <h2>What is included in the trip?</h2>
                <p>We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. We provide water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks</p>

                <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
                <p>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet. An indepth packing list will be emailed to you along with other confirmation information after you book your trip. </p>

                <h2> What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h2>
                <p>Are you kidding? What's not great about whitewater rafting! A common day on the river starts early in the morning after a night spent sleeping under a starry sky. A breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes is made while you pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. After setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company and dinner by the river</p>

                <h2>Question: How far in advance should I book my trip?</h2>
                <p>Answer: If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
