        Howdy!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Emily and this is a virtual home for all my fun fresh ideas. I love graphic design. I am often found not doing what I should be but rather messing around in adobe to create a new t-shirt design, a new wallpaper, or a new slide deck. For what purpose you might ask? Most of the time, no reason other than I had an idea and I wanted to get it down on paper (virtual paper that is).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am working hard to shift my passion into my career. Currently, I am grinding on that student life – up all night, too much caffeine and all the workarounds to certain copyrights. I have started my second bachelor’s program – ultimately to get certifications in software and web development. I hope to be able to combine my passion for creating and my intrigue of tech into a career in web development. You may just be able to find some of those fresh projects housed here too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully you find what you are looking for, and if not, hopefully you at least found something pretty to look at. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy, stick around for as long as you’d like.

        Feeling fresh – funky designs with a minimalist touch. A colorful palette but not cluttered.

        Presentation Slide Decks – made by a design aficionado trapped in the body of a corporate girlie 
      </p>
      <p>
        My design style has recently shifted – and I am working hard to drill down to the exact elements that will be my trusty pieces. I feel re-energized that the entire design world is revolving more around color, retro elements, hand drawn illustrations and blending all these elements with clean lines and minimalist formats. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend most of my time designing looking at or working on fonts. The power of words is great, but the power of pretty words. Even greater. I think that working on designs with this wholistic approach helps continue to inspire my process. From start to finish – I work on finding inspiration. Often, my work greatly shifts from where I have started in brainstorming to where I end up with the deliverables, but I enjoy it so deeply. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no preferred medium; I love digital deliverables as much as completing work on textiles. I think that all the different quirks of each medium can play so well into how you ultimately choose to complete a project.
