    <h2>Emily Rust</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Emily :) I have about a million and 2 nicknames that I have acquired through my life but the most recent, and my most favorite, is mama. My son, Jaxon, is almost 18 months old and is right on the cusp of using real words, so when I can get a mama from him (instead of adorable gibberish), my heart just wants to explode. My husband, Brandon, and I have been married for almost 5 years. During our first couple years of marriage, we lived in Provo, UT while we both finished school. Once we graduated, we escaped snowy and cold winters and headed south to Arizona. </p>
    <p>I graduated from BYU where I studied communications and business. I currently work in digital advertising on streaming TV. I decided to come back to school to transition my career into software development so I can stay home with my son more (and hopefully future kiddos too) and because of how prevalent software and coding is in every aspect of everything! In my job now, I use 6-7 different online software programs daily. I think that career opportunities will be better by switching from using the software to designing the software. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church for my entire life - both of my parents are descendants of pioneers who settled in Utah and Idaho in the early days of the church. I will say though that I only became fully converted to the gospel with my own true testimony when I was about 20 years old. My favorite quote is from Dieter F Uchtdorf “Choose to focus on those things that fill your soul with hope.” I try to live by this every day, it can be difficult between full time work and being a parent and a wife (and now a student) but I am really trying to find things about this program and being online with BYU-I that fill my soul with hope! </p>
